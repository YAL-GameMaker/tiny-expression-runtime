TXR is a demo project for my series on writing custom interpreters. It lets you compile and run snippets of GML-like code.

This can be used as a replacement for execute_string, for small-scale modding support, dialogue systems, or numerous other purposes.

You can choose which scripts to expose to interpreted code, have it access instance variables, process arguments, pause/resume execution, save/load execution state, inspect execution state, etc.
